# Lab 2: Getting started with TryHackMe.com (THM)

Estimated Time: 120 Mins

This week we'll be introducing the “TryHackMe.com” learning platform. We’ll be using this platform most weeks to supplement our lab activities. The platform offers both a free and paid membership, however the free membership offers a huge number of free labs and will be enough for this module. 

> 💡 The paid subscription is an excellent resource, but probably better suited for when you're studying for your certification exams, and you've exhausted the free labs

### 2.2 Enrol yourself onto the ‘Pre Security’ learning path. 

Once you have successfully created your account and logged in, you will be asked to enrol onto a learning path. We’ll start by enrolling on the Pre Security learning path. you can select the "Start learning" option Learning paths are essentially a collection of tutorials, related to a particular theme such as ‘Web Fundamentals’ or ‘Cyber Defense’ etc.  

>  💡 If you click on the ‘Learn' option along the top you'll have the option to view the different learning paths available for us to enrol onto. Below each Learning path you can a see a summary description of each path. 

When we first start the TryHackMe platform you’ll be guided through the site and the first room ‘Offensive Security Intro’ will be highlighted as a suggested starting point for us. So let’s get started with our first THM room. Offensive Security Intro

Our first Pre security learning path has 18 rooms across 5 topic areas for us to complete and is estimated to take about 40 hours, we’re not complete beginners and it should be closer to 10-12 hours for us to complete the entire learning path. You can think of each room as a separate lab, with some rooms grouped together under common themes or tasks like introduction, networking, Linux etc. 

You’ll notice that this learning path also offers a certificate of completion if you complete the pathway. So hopefully by the end of the term you’ll each be able to include several THM certificates on your CV. Some certifications are linked to industries certificates such as PenTest+ etc. and offer discounts if you complete the learning path. More incentives to complete the learning paths. 

> 💡 You’ll notice adverts to upgrade your account, and if your exploring room you notice that some features, and completing some certificates and room are only available to premium users. Again best left until you decide to want to add these to your CV or are working towards so actual Certs.

### 2.3 Completing our first room  

Each room has a learning section with new content for us to learn and a number of different tasks, each with a number of questions you’ll need to answer to complete that task. Some rooms will have websites or VMs associated with them for us to attack. 
 
Try complete your first THM room ‘Offensive Security Intro’ by following all the instructions and answering the questions for each task. 

Once you have completed your first room you should move onto the next step.

> 💡 You should plan to work your way through the remaining rooms in your own time and aim to complete all the free rooms in the Pre security learning path.

### 2.4 Learn to search all available rooms for suitable activities.  

Now that you have completed your first rooms, let’s look at how to find more rooms on the THM platform.  

At the top of your dashboard select the ‘Learn’ option, and select 'search' to see all the ‘Hacktivities’ available on the website. Clicking on the ‘Rooms’ link will give you options to filter all of the hacktivities on the site. 

Change the drop-down menus to show only ‘Free’ and ‘Easy’ rooms and browse through some of the options available for you to join.  
Search for the 'Nmap' room and join the room. You don't need to complete the room just yet.

### 2.5 Where Next? 

The more activities and CTFs etc you complete the more points to gain on the THM website, so feel free to explore and complete whatever rooms are of most interest to you. We’ll be working our way through more rooms each week, as we learn about new tools and techniques as part of the module.

While using the browser-based attack box is fine for some of the basic labs you will want to have your own attack VM for launching and running Penetration tests. 

So you should already have downloaded and installed the latest Kali Linux OS as a VM on your own machine, So the last part of this lap is to find and complete the OpenVPN room from THM.
