Estimated Time: 130 Mins
___

Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework.

___


## In this lab we will: 

In this lab we will:
1. Metasploit introduction
2. Metasploit demo against metasploitable 1
3. Metasploit demo against windows 
4. Using metasploit to exploit the Eternal Blue Windows vulnerability.

___


### 6.1 Metasploit introduction

To get us started, and fill in some of the background details, you should complete the Metasploit: Introduction room on THM. This first room introduces and explains the basic of the Metasploit tool.

### 6.2 Metasploit demo against metasploitable 1

Once we've completed the introductory material, you instructor will show you a walkthrough of exploiting the metasploitable 1 VM from our earlier labs. You should try to complete the same walkthrough yourself on your own VM, and make sure you understand each of the steps performed.

- Use metasploit to get access to your metasploitable 1 VM.
___


### 6.3 Metasploit demo against windows 

Old end of life products tend to always be vulnerable and obviously shouldn't appear on a live network because of the risks associated with such systems. Your instructor will show a walkthrough of exploiting a legacy windows XP system. If you'd like to attempt the same demo you can find the a Windows XP image and key, on the module resources section on Brightspace. 

- Use metasploit to get access to Windows XP

### 6.4 Using metasploit to exploit the Eternal Blue Windows vulnerability.

Similar to the last demo, but this time against a Win 7 system. The Blue room on THM steps you through performing a take over of a windows 7 system. Follow the steps to complete the room.
