Lab 2: Getting started with TryHackMe.com (THM)
Estimated Time: 120 Mins

This week we'll be introducing the “TryHackMe.com” learning platform. We’ll be using this platform most weeks to supplement our lab activities. The platform offers both a free and paid membership, however the free membership offers a huge number of free labs and will be enough for this module.

💡 The paid subscription is an excellent resource, but probably better suited for when you're studying for your certification exams, and you've exhausted the free labs

In this lab we will:

Before you begin this lab:

You should already have your attack machine (Kali VM) setup and configured.

You should have created an account on the TryHackMe Platform.

You should have created an account on the HackTheBox Platform.
